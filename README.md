# Flight Fare Prediction
Use Machine Learning Models to Predict Flight Fare after training the model with 2019 flight fare data. 

The pickle file where the model is stored can be recreated by running the code in the Jupyter Notebook. I have also provided a link from which anyone can access the pickle file:

I used Random Forest Regression to predict the Flight Fare. However, I did not stop at building the model. I built a web application using Flask, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
